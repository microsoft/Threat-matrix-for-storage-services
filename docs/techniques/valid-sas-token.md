    MITRE technique: 

A shared access signature (SAS) is a token, that is appended to the a uniform resource identifier (URI) for a storage resource, that grants restricted access rights over the associated resource in your storage account. Attackers may get a SAS token using one of the Credential Access techniques or during the reconnaissance process through social engineering.
