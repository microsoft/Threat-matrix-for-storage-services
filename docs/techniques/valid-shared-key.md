    MITRE technique: 

Attackers may get a shared key using one of Credential Access techniques or capture one earlier in their reconnaissance process through social engineering to gain initial access. Adversaries may leverage keys left in source code or configuration files. Sophisticated attackers may also obtain keys from hosts (virtual machines) that have mounted File Share on their system (SMB).  Shared key provides unrestricted permissions over all data plane operations.
