    MITRE technique:

 Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible shell for managing cloud resources. It provides the flexibility of shell experience, either Bash or PowerShell. To support the Cloud Shell promise of being accessible from everywhere, Cloud Shell profiles and session history are saved on storage account. Attackers may leverage the legitimate use of Cloud Shell to impersonate account owners and potentially obtain additional secrets logged as part of session history.
