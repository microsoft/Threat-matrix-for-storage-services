    MITRE technique: [T1020](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/)

Attackers may exploit legitimate automation processes, predefined by the compromised organization, with the goal of having their logging traces blend in normally within the companyâ€™s typical activities. Assimilating or disguising malicious intentions will keep adversary actions, such as data theft, stealthier.
