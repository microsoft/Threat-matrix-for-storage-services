    MITRE technique:

Attackers may obtain and abuse credentials of an SFTP account as a means of gaining initial access. SFTP is a prevalent file transfer protocol between a client and a remote service. Once the user connects to the cloud storage service, the user can upload and download blobs and perform other operations that are supported by the protocol. SFTP connection requires SFTP accounts which are managed locally in the storage service instance, including credentials in a form of passwords or key-pairs.
